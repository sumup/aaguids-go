# AAGUIDS

Small package mapping AAGUIDs (Authenticator Attestation Global Unique Identifier, an identifier for FIDO2 security keys) to their respective metadata from the [FIDO's Metadata Service (MDS)](https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/).

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/sumup/aaguids-go"
)

func main() {
  metadata, _ := aaguid.Passkeys["fbfc3007-154e-4ecc-8c0b-6e020557d7bd"]
  fmt.Println(metadata.Name)
}
```

> The FIDO Authenticator Metadata Specification defines so-called "Authenticator Metadata" statements. The metadata statements contains the "Trust Anchor" required to validate the attestation object, and they also describe several other important characteristics of the authenticator.
